This project is a high-fidelity geospatial intelligence platform designed for real-time flood risk monitoring and emergency routing. By fusing satellite weather telemetry with machine learning and topographical analysis, the system provides actionable life-safety data during extreme hydrological events.

The core of the platform lies in its Dual-Sync Weather Telemetry system. It aggregates real-time data from OpenWeatherMap for atmospheric conditions and Open-Meteo for high-resolution precipitation. This dual-source approach ensures data redundancy; if one sensor network experiences latency or failure, the system automatically recalibrates using the secondary source, providing uninterrupted monitoring during the most volatile weather conditions.

Risk assessment is powered by a Random Forest Regressor trained on a complex dataset of 12,000 environmental samples. Unlike simple threshold alerts, this model calculates risk through a weighted, non-linear interplay of environmental variables. It accounts for logarithmic precipitation impact, elevation-based accumulation risk—identifying low-lying "bowl" geographies—and soil saturation coefficients derived from humidity and temperature trends.

When a threat level exceeds the 70% critical threshold, the system initiates its Intelligent Rerouting logic. It performs a 4-point geospatial scan of the surrounding terrain to identify the nearest "Safe Haven" on high ground. The platform then injects a dynamic evacuation route directly onto the tactical map, providing users with the most efficient path to safety while simultaneously generating vehicle-specific safety protocols for sedans, SUVs, and heavy transport.

To ensure rapid response, the system includes a Broadcast SOS Signal feature. This allows users to immediately export tactical logs or broadcast their precise GPS coordinates and current threat level via emergency channels. By combining predictive modeling with immediate actionable steps, Pralay Kavach bridges the gap between raw environmental data and active disaster mitigation.
